## Abilities
Abilities represent aptitude in various tasks:
- *Agility* is using reflexes, speed, flexibility, balance, or dexterity.
- *Charisma* is using charm, influence, persuasion, intimidation, or deception.
- *Intellect* is using comprehension, knowledge, willpower, or spirit.
- *Perception* is using alertness, keen senses, aim, a sharp eye, or intuition.
- *Strength* is using brawn, brute force, endurance, stamina, or constitution.

## Ratings
Each ability has a rating that we add to related checks. Ratings are initially determined at character creation and change each session. Ratings range from -3 to +6.

## Ability Checks
If you perform a challenging and risky action or react to a threat, the GM may call for an ability check:
- Talk to the GM to determine which ability best fits your action.
- Ask for potential consequences and adjust your action if desired.
- Consider your conditions. Apply any appropriate bonuses or penalties.
- The GM may apply advantage or disadvantage due to preparations, position, or the situation.
- Roll a d20 and add the rating for the selected ability:
  - On a natural 20, it’s a *critical success*. You do it with extra effect!
  - On a 16 or better, it’s a *full success*. You do it, avoiding trouble.
  - On a 10-15, it’s a *partial success*. You mostly succeed, but there’s a
cost, tough choice, or trouble.
  - On a 9 or less, it’s a *failure*. You don't do it. There's a cost, choice, or trouble. Mark the failure box.
  - On a natural 1, it’s a *critical failure*. Expect the worst and mark the failure box.

## Ability Check Boxes
If you fail an ability check, mark the failure box beside it. At the end of the session, you get an XP and then roll to see if that ability gets better or worse.

## Skilled Checks
When you make a skilled check, a failure counts as a partial success (but you still mark the failure box). The GM may grant a skilled check if you have a background that applies to an action. Talents also provide skills. You may gain special skills from peculiar sources or critical successes.

## Advantage & Disadvantage
The GM may apply one of these to an ability check due to the circumstances that your character is acting under:
- *Advantage* is gained when you’re well-prepared, in a dominant position, or the situation is in your favor. Roll 2d20 and take the best result.
- *Disadvantage* is gained when you’re ill-prepared, in a bad position, or the action is extremely unlikely to work. Roll 2d20 and take the worst result.

Advantage cancels out disadvantage and vice versa. Multiple 'vantages don't stack (you either have one or you don't).

## Assistance & Obstruction
Up to two characters can *Assist* a PC with an ability check. Each assistant provides a +1 bonus to the roll but is exposed to any risks or mishaps.

PCs may also *Obstruct* each other's actions. This may create risk where
otherwise there was none, or apply a -1 penalty to an already risky roll for each obstructor, up to two. Obstructors are exposed to any retaliation, risk, or mishaps as appropriate for the action.
