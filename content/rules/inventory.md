## Items & Slots
Items you carry are stored in *slots*. You can't carry more items than you have slots available.

Some items are *heavy*. You can carry 1 + Strength heavy items (minimum 0). Additional heavy items cause you to become encumbered. *Very heavy* items count as two. Mark the boxes next to the slot to indicate heavy items. Some extremely large and awkward items (like crates and chests) are *oversized*, so cumbersome that they can only be lugged around by two or more people and cannot be part of your inventory.

You have 6 equipment slots for items attached directly to you with scabbards, clips, straps, twine, or buckles. No rummaging is required.

Apparel slots are for things you're currently wearing, including armor, clothes, boots, cloaks, etc.

Pouches and pots hold tiny items (like coins or gems), liquid, or fine substances (like powders or sand). They take up an item slot.

Quivers hold 3 stacks of ammo and scroll cases hold 3 scrolls. These don't require rummaging.

Rummaging means all your attention goes to digging something out of a bag or your pockets for a moment, so you're distracted and vulnerable.

*Tiny* things (like keys, slips of paper, gems, coins, etc), don't require slots and are noted in the pockets box. Items in your pockets require a moment of rummaging to retrieve.

You can fit up to 100 coins in your pockets. Additional coins must be
stored in equipment or container slots. Each slot can hold a maximum of 500 coins. The slot becomes heavy if holding more than 250.

## Supply Dice

Some items are expendable and using them may deplete your supply. These items can be stored in a single item slot as a stack and have a *Supply Die* that represents how much of that thing you have left. When you use
that item, roll the supply die. On a 1-2, some supply is expended and
the die size is degraded by one step on the chain: d12 > d10 > d8 > d6 > d4. If you roll a 1-2 on a d4, your supply is depleted.

The starting supply die is noted on the equipment list for supply
items. Purchasing additional quantities of that item increases the die size by one step up to d12.
