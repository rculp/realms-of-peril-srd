Countless varieties of species, races, cultures, and ethnicities live,trade, and fight amongst each other, some human-like while others not at all. While humans make up the majority of adventurers, others such as the proud dwarves, shrewd elves, and diminutive halflings occasionally set out to explore the wilderness.

Non-human PCs have their own lists of names, backgrounds, and talents. When they level up, they can gain a talent from the main adventuring classes, or select one from their own list instead.
