## Hit Points

Your PC has a reserve of hit points (HP) that represent their ability to take a beating and avoid fatal damage from combat and other hazards. Consider it luck, divine favor, uncanny resilience, fate, etc. Instead of mortal wounds, you take mere scratches, bumps, bruises, black eyes, and dinged armor - unpleasant but doesn’t hold you back much. When you run out of hit points, you are vulnerable to actual wounds and death.

> **Maximum Hit Points**
>
> 10 + Strength + Level

You may get special abilities to gain extra HP. Track your max and current HP on your character sheet as you take damage.

Monsters and NPCs have HP too. When they hit 0 hit points, they're typically dead on the spot.

There’s no penalty when you lose HP, but when you drop to 0, it’s bad news - make a death check. You never go below 0 HP, but any damage beyond that is considered overkill damage.

## Death Checks

If you drop to 0 HP, roll a d20 with a penalty equal to any overkill damage.
- On a natural 20, you're okay.
- On a 16+, you're unconscious.
- On 10-15, you're unconscious and wounded.
- On 6-9, you're unconscious, wounded, and dying.
- On 5 or less, you're dead! Rest in peace.
- On a natural 1, you’re dead but somehow it’s worse than that! The GM will say how.

## Recovery

You can recover in these ways:
- Take a break: Spend a turn uninterrupted to catch your breath. Removes the Winded condition.
- Rest: Spend a watch resting in the wilderness or dungeon to regain 1d4 hp, or 2d4 hp if using safe lodging.
- Sleep: Spend two watches sleeping in the wilderness to regain 2d4 hp, or 4d4 hp if using safe lodging.
- Downtime: A PC regains all HP during downtime. If wounded, do not gain back HP unless you use the Recuperate downtime action to remove that condition.

Conditions may be removed when recovering, per the GM. Once per day, during a break, bandages can be used to heal +1 hit point. Bandages can also be used once to attempt to remove the dying condition.
