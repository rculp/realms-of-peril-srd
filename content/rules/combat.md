## Combat Checks
When you attack an enemy in combat, the GM may require an ability check that reveals not just your success, but the enemy’s retaliation or counter-attack.
- Try to be descriptive and say what it looks like when you attack.
- Consider position, range, and conditions. Is there any advantage or disadvantage on the roll?
- Roll a d20 and add the rating for the correct ability:
  - On a natural 20, it’s a *critical hit*! Make a critical hit roll!
  - On a 16+, do damage and avoid retaliation and mishap.
  - On a 10-15, do damage but suffer retaliation, a mishap, or the situation intensifies.
  - On a 9 or less, you inflict no damage and suffer retaliation or other consequences. Mark the failure box.
  - On a natural 1, you are critically hit or fumble badly!

Note: If you attack a victim helpless to defend themselves, just roll damage. Likewise, if you are defenseless, you may just suffer damage appropriate to the threat.

## Damage

Damage dice are based on the weapon used. Players roll damage dice for their
attacks as well as damage inflicted upon them. When a PC inflicts damage, add the ability rating from the combat check to the damage result (min 0 damage).

Damage done to PCs is determined by the GM based on the enemy attack or hazard that is causing the harm. Damage points are subtracted from the target’s HP. Monsters and NPCs die when they hit 0 HP. PCs make a *Death Check* to see if they survive.

## Advantages on Damage

If you have advantage on damage, roll the damage die twice and take the better result. If you have disadvantage on damage, roll two damage dice and take the worse result.

## Weapon Properties
Each weapon has unique properties and inflicts a different amount of damage.

## Weapon Ranges
Close range is in reach of your hand or a short weapon (about a single pace away). Near is within 5 paces away. Far is beyond that but still within 50 paces. Distant is past far but still within sight.

The GM may apply a vantage due to your position given your weapon’s range versus that of your enemy. You may suffer disadvantage trying to use a weapon outside of its listed ranges.

> Close -> Near -> Far -> Distant

## Dual Wielding
You can hold a one-handed weapon in each hand and choose which to use when attacking. Using a weapon in your offhand that doesn't have that property incurs disadvantage on attacks.

## Armor & Shields
If the armor you’re wearing is effective against the source of damage you take, reduce the damage received by your armor’s AR value (Armor Rating).

Holding a shield provides +1 AR. You can also just tell the GM you want to block a threat with your shield. The GM may call for a roll to see if you succeed. Threats can be thwarted this way.
