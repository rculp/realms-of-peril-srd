## Conditions

When a PC suffers an injury, status effect, or other special circumstance, the GM may assign a condition.

- Consider conditions when rolling ability checks. Conditions always exist in the fiction and should affect the descriptions of your actions if relevant.
- Some conditions may have ratings (usually 1-3) that represent the severity or potency. If the condition is helpful, the GM may apply the rating as a bonus to your check. If it's hindering your action, the GM may apply the rating as a penalty.
- Certain conditions may prevent you from taking some or all actions. However, you may be able to push yourself and roll to act despite the condition. Likewise, some conditions may allow a PC to bypass something that would normally require a check or even be impossible.
- Some conditions wear off with time while others require rest, items, aid, or even magic to remove them. PCs should attempt actions to relieve unwanted conditions. The GM can provide suggestions on how to relieve a condition and will say how effective your attempts are. Recovering from some conditions may require an ability check.

## Typical Conditions

The GM will make customized conditions when necessary, but here are some common conditions PCs regularly deal with:

### Blinded
You can't see. Fail all ability checks that require vision, or the GM may apply a penalty.

### Clumsy
Gain a penalty equal to the AR of the clumsy armor on Agility and arcane spellcasting checks.

### Dead
You have perished! Don't worry, it's part of the game. Mourn the loss, celebrate the glorious demise, roll a new character, and sally forth again!

### Deafened
You can't hear. Fail all ability checks that require hearing, or penalty to the roll.

### Diseased
You are suffering from a sickness or disease. Penalty to ability checks. May worsen and cause additional conditions.

### Dying
You're dying and will soon perish without help. Make a death check every turn until you remove this condition with medical aid, a lucky critical success, or healing magic. Suffer a -1 penalty for each consecutive check. If someone spends a turn bandaging you up, they can make an Intellect check to attempt to remove this condition.

### Encumbered
You're carrying too many heavy items. Penalty to Strength and Agility checks equal to the number of extra heavy items, maximum 3. Dropping excess items removes this condition.

### Exhausted
You're totally sapped of energy. -2 penalty to Strength and Agility checks. Sleeping or resting at least one watch removes this condition.

### Hungry
After a day with no food, you are hungry. Start a tally of days without food if this continues. Remove this condition by eating food.

### Panicked
You're stricken with fear and can't do anything other than panic, flee, or hide without pushing yourself. Penalty to Charisma, Intellect, and Perception checks.

### Poisoned
You are suffering from poison or venom. Penalty to ability checks. May worsen and cause additional conditions.

### Sleep Deprived
You've failed to get sufficient sleep. -2 to all checks. Sleeping at least one watch removes this condition but you're sleepy. Sleeping two watches removes it completely.

### Sleepy
You've only gotten 4 hours of sleep in the past day. If another day passes without getting a full two watches of sleep, you become Sleep Deprived.

### Starving
After a week of no food, you're starving. -3 to all checks. You die after three weeks with no food. Remove with three days of consistent food.

### Stranded
You've been lost or left behind in the wilderness. This PC cannot adventure again until the Rescue downtime action is performed.

### Stunned
You're confused and dazed. Penalty to Intellect checks.

### Thirsty
After a day with no water, you are thirsty and dehydrated. Start a tally of days without water. Penalty to all checks equal to the tally. You die after three days without water. Removed with an ample amount of water to drink.

### Unconscious
Sleeping or knocked-out; prone, vulnerable, and unaware. Can't act or react at all.

### Unsteady
You have lost feeling or balance, are dizzy, or can't stop shaking. Penalty to Agility checks.

### Upset
You're socially or emotionally upset. Penalty to Charisma checks.

### Winded
You're out of breath. -1 penalty to Strength and Agility checks. Take a break and catch your breath to remove this condition.

### Wounded
You're mortally wounded. You can't recover any HP until you use the Recuperate downtime action to remove this condition.
