## Surviving the Wilds

Time in the wilds is tracked in days split into six watches: dawn, morning, afternoon, evening, dusk, and night, each roughly 4 hours long.

Wilderness activities each take one watch to complete: camping, resting, hiking, scouting, and gathering.

PCs generally perform activities as a party, but it's possible to split up, allowing smaller groups to perform different activities.

The GM makes an event check (per group) to determine if anything happens during a watch. Events are not always bad, and some may be useful opportunities. Some events may interrupt a wilderness activity and waste time.

## Hiking

Hiking allows the party to move across long distances. Tell the GM your destination or heading. Deal with any events that happen. If an event doesn't waylay your progress, you move towards your destination. The GM will describe your progress and the sights along the way.

It's up to you to track and map your location, or else purchase maps from NPCs and follow those.

Traveling cautiously and stealthily reduces your speed but allows you to get the jump on any events that happen along the way.

Mounted PCs may be able to move faster while hiking and/or carry more items. Mounts, like other pets, require upkeep, feed, and attention. Failing to care for your mount may result in them abandoning you, becoming sick, or dying.

## Scouting

Scouting allows the party to strategically search or interact with an area, looking for camping spots, pathways, discoveries, landmarks, etc. The GM may require a Perception check to locate something specific.

Scouting can also be used to find your way again after becoming lost or to find a suitable place to camp.

## Resting 

Resting requires the PCs to find a safe place to relax, heals 1d4 HP per watch, and may relieve some conditions, per the GM.

PCs may perform various activities while resting like reading, eating, snoozing, chatting, or using some items, per the GM.

## Camping 

Camping allows the party to sleep while in the wilderness. It counts as sleeping towards daily requirements and allows the PCs to heal 1d4 HP per watch.

Camping is a good time to socialize and share something cool about your character. This could be a story they tell, a role-playing moment, or a little vignette that highlights their personality or background.

Camping can be dangerous. Groups often establish a watch order. If there is an event during the night, the PC on watch at the time will have the first opportunity to deal with it. Otherwise, if no one is on watch, the PCs may be surprised in their sleep!

An event may interrupt camping and cause the party to not get proper sleep, running the risk of becoming sleepy or sleep deprived. Use the scout action to find a suitable place to camp or else the risk of mishap is higher.

## Gathering

PCs may attempt to hunt, fish, or forage to gain food or resources with a Perception check. The GM will describe what is obtained, if anything.

Hunting requires ranged weapons or traps, and an area with huntable game. It produces a supply-die of meat.

Fishing requires a lake, river, stream, or sea, as well as fishing gear, and produces a supply-die of fish.

Foraging requires nearby vegetation and produces a supply-die of fruits, vegetables, nuts, mushrooms, etc.

Fresh water is presumed available in most places. If an area is arid, toxic, or underground, you may need to forage for drinkable water. Waterskins allow you to carry a day's worth of water.

## Travel Exhaustion

Hiking, gathering, and scouting are strenuous. Such activities can only be taken up to twice per day without risking fatigue. PCs who proceed past this must make a Strength check to avoid becoming exhausted.

## Getting Lost and Rescued

At the end of a game session, each PC needs to make it back to safe haven. With clear heading, ample supplies, and if traveling through familiar territory, the party may simply be able to trek home unhindered.

If the PCs must make a long and dangerous trip to reach safety, the GM may call for a navigation check to see if they can make it home without incident.

If the PCs fail to make it home, they gain the stranded condition. A stranded PC may not be used on another adventure without first performing the Rescue downtime to bring them back to town. Warning: they may not make it back unscathed!
