## Narrate Your Actions
Make it clear what you are doing, how you’re reacting, or what you want to know. Put yourself in your character’s shoes. Describe your PC’s actions and intentions as if you are that character.

## Roll the Dice
If your action is risky, the GM may call on you to make an **ability check**. Roll a d20, add an ability rating, and hope to roll high!

## GM Describes Results
The GM, with Player input, describes the results of rolls. Checks perform **double-duty**, determining if you are **successful** and if you run into any **trouble** along the way. This includes an enemy’s retaliation!
