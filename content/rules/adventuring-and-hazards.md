## Architecture & Doors

A PC can spend a turn and make an Perception check to inspect a structure or building, seeking clues about how it was built, who built it, how it's laid out, if it's safe to pass through, how a floor slopes, etc.

Locked doors are impassable unless a key is used, the door is broken down, or the lock is picked.

Breaking down a wooden door requires an axe while stone doors require picks. A crowbar may be used to pry open some doors. Breaking down doors usually requires at least one turn of loud work.

Picking locks requires a set of lockpicks and an Agility check.

Some doors are just stuck and may be forced with a Strength check.

Cave-ins, rock-slides, and collapsing structures can cause grievous damage.

## Building & Digging

PCs can build things with Intellect checks, sufficient time, materials, and proper tools, per the GM. Disadvantage on the check if using improvised tools.

A PC can dig an area of earth one cubic pace per turn with a shovel, or per hour if the earth is particularly difficult to excavate with a pick. It takes twice as long without a shovel or pick.

## Climbing & Falling

A PC can make either an Agility or Strength check to climb treacherous rocks, inclines, or walls. Climbing ladders or ropes doesn't usually require a check but may if there are other dangers involved. Sheer surfaces can't be climbed without the thief talent.

Suffer 1d6 damage for every 5 paces you fall. Jumping down (instead of falling) reduces the distance by 5 paces.

## Disease & Sickness

Diseases may be contracted if an adventurer comes in contact with sewage, toxic materials, swamp water, etc. A PC may have a chance to make a Strength check to see if they can resist contracting the disease. Diseases cause a variety of debilitating effects, each unique to the specific sickness.

## Drowning & Suffocating

A PC can hold their breath for 1 + Strength rating (minimum 1) minutes before they suffocate or drown.

PCs who have gone without air for less than 10 minutes may be resuscitated.

## Language & Literacy

Unless otherwise noted, all PCs can speak and read Common, the trade language widely used in the known world. Some PCs may know other languages or learn them via the research downtime.

PCs can make an Intellect check to see if they can translate an unfamiliar language.

## Light & Vision

Most PCs cannot see in the dark so things like candles, torches, and lanterns are very useful to access dark places. Without light, your PC effectively suffers the Blinded condition while in the dark.

## Mysterious Items

Some items you find may have unknown properties. You can experiment with mysterious items to
determine if they have any special qualities or use the research downtime to identify them. You may also be able to pay some sages to identify items.

## Mapping & Movement

The GM describes the locations that PCs explore and it's up to them to map it. In a dungeon, spend 10 minutes studying the layout of a room or corridor to map it more thoroughly, in which case the GM will provide more concrete assistance with the map.

PCs can move about 500 paces per turn and about 12 miles per watch.

## Parlay

PCs can attempt to strike up dialog with creatures encountered in the wilds. This usually requires a Charisma check, if possible at all.

## Poison & Venom

Poison and venom comes in various forms with different effects that cause conditions like weakened, sickened, dizziness, unconsciousness, or death.

A PC might be able to make a Strength check to fend off poisons and venoms.

## Sleep & Sustenance

PCs need 8 hours (2 watches) of sleep per day. With only 4 hours of sleep, gain the Sleepy condition. PCs become Sleep Deprived after a full day without sleep.

After a day without food, PCs gain the Hungry condition. Start a tally of days without food if this continues. After a week, gain the Starving condition. PCs die after 3 weeks without food.

After a day with no water, gain the Thirsty condition. Start a tally of days without water if this continues. You die after 3 days without water.

## Stealth

A PC can make an Agility check to attempt to sneak or hide, avoiding detection. Using stealth requires darkness, shadow, or cover, and the enemy must not yet be aware of you.

## Swimming

All PCs know how to swim unless otherwise noted in their background. Swimming long distances or in treacherous waters requires a Strength check, Disadvantage if Encumbered.

## Tracking Time

Time is tracked based on the situation:
- In high-paced action situations, time is tracked in moments (about 6 seconds). Characters can usually move and do one or two things per moment.
- Time spent exploring dangerous places such as dungeons, ruins, or lairs is tracked in turns (about 10 minutes).
- Time spent traveling or camping in the wilderness is tracked in segments called watches (about 4 hours).
- Time resting in a settlement is tracked in days or weeks. Adventurers also get downtime actions when spending long periods of time in a settlement (between sessions).
- The GM guides the use of time. Every player gets a chance to act in each segment of time, per the GM.

## Traps & Disabling Them

Traps include spike pits, poison darts, crushing ceilings, pitfalls, etc. If you enter a trapped area or interact with a trapped object, the GM will call for a check to determine if and how badly the trap affects your character.

Disabling a trap usually requires an Agility or Intellect check, per the GM. It may also require tools in some cases.
