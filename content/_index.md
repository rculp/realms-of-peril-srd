## About Realms of Peril

***Realms of Peril*** is a fantasy role-playing adventure game where we tell thrilling tales of swords and sorcery. Take on the role of a bold adventurer, member of a ragtag party of mercenaries, scoundrels, zealots, and warlocks who explore untamed wilderness and face terrible foes, winning treasure and power with cunning and might. Together we play to find out what happens to the group, cheering their victories and lamenting their failures. When we look back, we'll see the amazing tale we've created together. You never know what the next adventure will bring!
